# Feed

Feed is a news aggregator designed to save myself the time and hassle of visiting numerous websites
to stay up to date. It uses a combination of Google news API and Scrapy (web crawler & HTML scraper) to pull articles from various news sources.
Finally I use IBM Watson's natural language processing to extract keywords and remove redundant articles


**To implement**:
- N/A
